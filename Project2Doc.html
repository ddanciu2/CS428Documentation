          <p> This second project consists of an office space with 2 floors each dedicated with it's own phobia with several features created in Unity. 
              <br><br>
              When downloaded/clone from GitHub
              and opened correctly using the Unity Hub, there are two ways to run the project (Depending on the device). Your headset must be connected to your PC/Laptop. 
              The first method (Windows) can be done by switching to the Android platform and clicking "Build" to build/save the apk file in a desired location. You will have the follow some 
              preinstall instructions to get an oculus driver and "ADB" software to sideload the apk file to your Oculus headset 
              from this link <a target="_blank" href="https://uploadvr.com/how-to-sideload-apps-oculus-go/">here</a>. Once the ADB software is setup, run the command from the website with the path to 
              your apk file and it was install on your headset, which can be run by going to the (Apps > Unknown Sources > Your Project) and clicking your project title. The second method (Mac) can be 
              done by switching to the Android platform and clicking "Build and Run" which will prompt you to save the apk file in a desired location and will automatically start up the project on your headset.
              <br><br>
              Both of these floors will have similar things including models found throughout the floor, models that you can pick up and throw, models that are interactable that will spawn new objects,
              models/areas in the map with different sounds, and special lighting to help enchance viewing models. The difference between the two floors is just it's respective phobia and all the models, 
              sounds, and etc. related to that floor.
              <br><br>
              The phobias we are currently have setup in our project is bugs (floor 1) and aliens (floor 2). Both these floors would help a person work through their phobia by allowing them to be
              immersed into actually feeling like they are seeing real models related to their phobias, but without it actually being real and causing them physical harm. The user would be able to 
              deal with multiple scenarios of going face to face with a model and seeing that it can't actually do anything to them. The user can go on their own pace to interact with models using their hands, 
              or picking models up like an ant or touching an alien model, which allows the user to eventually get comfortable enough with their own phobia and eventually lose their fear.

            <h2>Explaination for models/sounds</h2>
            <p>
              The MergeCube is based in Kyoto Japan, where Nintendo was founded. Choosing this theme gave me a wide range of ideas of models and audio to create and choose. Nintendo is already
              as big as it in America, but the country that founded Nintendo is defintely more integrated with all their creations and is a big part of their country.
              With a Nintendo theme I chose things all relating to Nintendo games in some format. With this theme I decided to choose assets from their most iconic games made by Nintendo. 
              I decided to add models including the Hylian shield from Zelda, the pokeball from pokemon, and the question block from mario games  as these are all well known items in 
              Nintendo games. One of Nintendo's best games of all time is Super Smash Bros. Therefore, I was inspired to make a model relating to the game with the classic Super Smash Bros.
              symbol with a famous line from the game "Challenger approaching!" when you get a chance to unlock a new character. I also made one of my favorite items from Super Smash
              Bros. called the "Beam Sword", with a purple blade and custom colored grip for each sword to represent it as two different players dueling. All of my models clearly represent
              iconic items from Nintendo based in Kyoto Japan. The music I chose is from the Wii console's menu theme, which has a nice chill ambient vibe and was made by Nintendo. I chose the
              whip sound for the Magic 8-Ball as it makes for a good sound effect for a quick change of text.

            <h2>Explaination for models/sounds/8ball sayings</h2>
              <p>
                The ClassCube is based in Phoenix Arizona desert/location theme. The first thing I think of when I think about Airzona is a desert. With this theme I decided to 
                choose things that relate to the desert and things relating to the location itself. I chose things from the web that are iconic in Phoenix Arizona which include oranges,
                cactuses and it's famous Botanic Garden. All of these models comes from Phoenix Arizona, as they are known for growing oranges, having cactuses, and their popular
                Botanic Garden. The creation of my models were inspired by my background knowledge of Phoenix Arizona that I've obtained from family living there and personal experience.
                I know that Phoenix Arizona has some of the best golf courses in the nation as they almost have perfect golfing weather and best rated courses. Phoenix Arizona is also the city
                tourists stay at and start their drive from before they go to see Horseshoe Bend, a famous national mountuem and very popular tourist spot. All of the models revolve around
                Phoenix Arizona as a whole on what they have. The sound/music I chose is a representation of the ambient sound you would hear out in the desert with wind blowing and birds
                making sounds. I chose the whip sound for the Magic 8-Ball as it makes for a good sound effect for a quick change of text. 
                <br><br>
                For the custom Magic 8-Ball sayings for the Classcube,
                I decided to go with some slang that younger generations use today. Phrases like these are popular with teens and people in their 20s. Some of the positive responces like
                "No Doubt, answer = yes" and "100% Yes" is just a way of saying yes and assuring the other person. The neutral responces like "I don't know boss" is just a way of saying the person isn't 
                sure while also complimenting the person as a sign of respect by calling them a boss. The negative respones like "Fat L, answer = no" is to signify that what you wanted or asked
                for is not happening and out of the question. The other negative responces like "Bruh, no way" is a way of signifying a surprised reaction and saying no in responce, 
                "No Shot" just means there is no possiblitly in that happening, and "Sorry fam, but no" is a negative responce as that you want to say the person is your good friend, but the answer
                is still no.
