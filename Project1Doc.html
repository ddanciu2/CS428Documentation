          <p>This first project consists of two Cubes with target images detected by your camera which will display several features created in Unity. Both of these cubes will both 
            have simliar things including a Magic 8-Ball with text that changes when the cube is flipped, the display name of a geographic location with the temperature and weather
            conditions, and several models relating to the displayed geographic location. The difference between the two cubes is the geographic location with its related models 
            and the Magic 8-Ball sayings.

            <h2>Explaination for models/sounds</h2>
            <p>
              The MergeCube is based in Kyoto Japan, where Nintendo was founded. Choosing this theme gave me a wide range of ideas of models and audio to create and choose. Nintendo is already
              as big as it in America, but the country that founded Nintendo is defintely more integrated with all their creations and is a big part of their country.
              With a Nintendo theme I chose things all relating to Nintendo games in some format. With this theme I decided to choose assets from their most iconic games made by Nintendo. 
              I decided to add models including the Hylian shield from Zelda, the pokeball from pokemon, and the question block from mario games  as these are all well known items in 
              Nintendo games. One of Nintendo's best games of all time is Super Smash Bros. Therefore, I was inspired to make a model relating to the game with the classic Super Smash Bros.
              symbol with a famous line from the game "Challenger approaching!" when you get a chance to unlock a new character. I also made one of my favorite items from Super Smash
              Bros. called the "Beam Sword", with a purple blade and custom colored grip for each sword to represent it as two different players dueling. All of my models clearly represent
              iconic items from Nintendo based in Kyoto Japan. The music I chose is from the Wii console's menu theme, which has a nice chill ambient vibe and was made by Nintendo. I chose the
              whip sound for the Magic 8-Ball as it makes for a good sound effect for a quick change of text.

              <p>
                The ClassCube is based in Phoenix Arizona desert/location theme. The first thing I think of when I think about Airzona is a desert. With this theme I decided to 
                choose things that relate to the desert and things relating to the location itself. I chose things from the web that are iconic in Phoenix Arizona which include oranges,
                cactuses and it's famous Botanic Garden. All of these models comes from Phoenix Arizona, as they are known for growing oranges, having cactuses, and their popular
                Botanic Garden. The creation of my models were inspired by my background knowledge of Phoenix Arizona that I've obtained from family living there and personal experience.
                I know that Phoenix Arizona has some of the best golf courses in the nation as they almost have perfect golfing weather and best rated courses. Phoenix Arizona is also the city
                tourists stay at and start their drive from before they go to see Horseshoe Bend, a famous national mountuem and very popular tourist spot. All of the models revolve around
                Phoenix Arizona as a whole on what they have. The sound/music I chose is a representation of the ambient sound you would hear out in the desert with wind blowing and birds
                making sounds. I chose the whip sound for the Magic 8-Ball as it makes for a good sound effect for a quick change of text.
